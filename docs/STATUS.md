# Status

Updated 2026-10-20 (task/5.x-refinement-volumes: user refinement volumes, GPU selection under WSL).
Phases and sub-phases are those of docs/PLAN.md. Updated at the end of every task (CLAUDE.md).

## Current branch

**task/5.x-refinement-volumes** (not yet published; it starts from task/5.3-cfmesh, which is not
published either). No OpenFOAM command was run in this task (another heavy process was running).
Done on it:
- Part A (D-103, [NUMERICS-REVIEW], schema v12): user refinement volumes (box with pitch and yaw,
  cylinder, sphere, cone) with a target cell size mapped to a refinement level (rounded towards the finer
  level; achieved size and level shown; warning when finer than the finest part surface level);
  snappyHexMeshDict geometry entries as v2606 searchable shapes (searchableBox / searchableRotatedBox,
  searchableCylinder, searchableSphere, searchableCone) and inside-mode refinementRegions; extra cells in
  the estimate and the cell budget; volumes wholly outside the domain are not written (error), partly
  outside ones warn; Edit > Add Wake Volume (a box aligned with the free stream behind the parts); the
  "Refinement volumes" tree node under Mesh, numeric editing with units, a live translucent outline in the
  viewer; one undo step per edit, every edit puts the mesh out of date; not in presets. The real-mesh test
  (`slow`) was written but not run.
- Part B (D-104): under WSL with a display, GALLIUM_DRIVER=d3d12 and MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME=NVIDIA
  are set before Qt or VTK load unless the user set them; the OpenGL renderer string is written to the
  console once the viewer exists.

Earlier on task/5.3-cfmesh (D-102, benchmarks/RESULT_5.3.md): the cfMesh evaluation; recommendation keep
snappyHexMesh and move to 5.4 (QUESTIONS 130, owner decision pending).

Next candidates: 5.4 prism layers (items 87, 106, 111, 122, 124); drag handles for the refinement volumes
(item 132). Open: docs/QUESTIONS.md items 30, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 82, 87, 89 to 94, 96, 97, 106,
111, 122, 124 and 125 to 137.

## Known issues

- Results at angle of attack != 0 are biased by the angled-inlet method with slip far field (QUESTIONS 71, open).

## Known debts

- GPU environment variables (GALLIUM_DRIVER=d3d12, MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME=NVIDIA) are set in
  the user's ~/.bashrc; the app should set them at startup when they are not set.
- numpy is imported directly (geometry/checks.py, gui/scene.py, gui/viewport.py) but is not declared in
  pyproject.toml (it arrives through pyvista).
- Courant number: parsed from logs (foam/logparse.py) but no warning in the GUI.
- Parallel speedup saturates at about 3 on 8 cores (memory-bandwidth bound, docs/validation/parallel/README.md); the recommended-core cap of 4 is a constant for this machine (item 69).
- Location of user projects and run outputs in the released app (run/ is development only).
- Changing a CAD part's deflection re-tessellates from the CAD and drops an earlier repair (D-072).
- Preset boundary types are stored but there is one boundary type per role today (QUESTIONS 78, for the internal-flow task).
- cfMesh build spike on v2606.
- Total cell estimate: only background cells are estimated today (curvature refinement is reported as its finest level, D-085).
- Per-part surface size (one target surface size for all parts today).
- Solver restart from the latest time: every run starts from 0 (D-046).
- The mesh scene is read on the GUI thread after meshing (MeshView.load): a multi-million-cell mesh
  freezes the window for a moment (docs/QUESTIONS.md item 5).
- Flat plate Cf is 3.3 % below the TMR incompressible SST reference (grid-extrapolated Cf(0.97),
  D-036) and the gap is not explained. Candidates: the omegaWallFunction blending, OpenFOAM's SST
  implementation (TMR's note on standard OpenFOAM), nutUSpaldingWallFunction.
